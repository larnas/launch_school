/* 
If you thought that the outputs would be 0.9 and true, respectively, you were wrong. 
JavaScript uses floating point numbers for all numeric operations. 
Most floating point representations used on computers lack a 
certain amount of precision, and that can yield unexpected results like these.

In this case, the output was:

0.8999999999999999
