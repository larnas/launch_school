// Write a loop that logs greeting three times.

/*
Discussion

For both kinds of loops, we declare a counter variable count to keep track of 
how many iterations we've been through. We start by assigning it to 1, and then 
increment it on each iteration of the loop. As soon as it is greater than 3, 
the condition provided to the loop returns false and the loop is terminated.
