// Write a while loop that logs all odd natural numbers between 1 and 40.
let num = 1;
while (num <= 40) {
 if (num % 2 === 1) {
   console.log(num);
 } 
 num += 1;
}

/*
It loops over all numbers from 1 to 40 and uses an if statement to determine 
whether or not num should be logged. In order to check whether num is even, we would 
use the condition num % 2 === 0, which checks whether num is divisible
by 2 without remainder. In order to determine whether a number is odd, we simply negate it.

The trick in our solution code is that we know that each second number is odd, 
so if we start at 1, we can simply increment the number by 2 on each iterating, 
effectively looping only over the odd numbers.
