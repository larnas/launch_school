On line 5, we access the array element at the current index, and log the 
returned element to the console with console.log. Subsequently, we increment index by 1.

After each iteration of the loop, our while condition is evaluated. 
Since JavaScript arrays have a zero-based index, we want to terminate 
the loop when index is equal to array.length, because the last index of 
an array is always one less than the array's length.
