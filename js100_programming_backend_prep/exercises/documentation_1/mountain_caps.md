Is there a method to capitalize a string, for example turning 'mountain' into 'Mountain'?

Answer
There is one for whole string

String.prototype.toUpperCase()

Solution
There is no built-in method for capitalizing a string. If we wanted to have such a method, we would have to implement it ourselves.
