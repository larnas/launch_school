There is more than one way to achieve this. Arguably the most straightforward one 
is to use the String.prototype.replace() method. Another possibility is to extract 
the first part of the input string, 'Captain', and concatenate it with 'JavaScript'. 
For example:
*/
'Captain Ruby'.substring(0, 8) + 'JavaScript';

'Captain Ruby'.split(' ')[0] + ' JavaScript';
