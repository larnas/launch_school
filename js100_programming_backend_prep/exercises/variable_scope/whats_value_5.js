/* 
ReferenceError: Cannot access 'a' before initialization

Your initial hunch might have been that this code should output the 
numbers 1 (on line 5) and 2 (on line 7). The reason that doesn't happen is that variables 
declared by let aren't available until the code runs. Therefore, the let statement 
on line 6 creates a new variable a that isn't available on line 5. Since we try to 
log a before assigning it a value, a ReferenceError is raised.

Technically, the scope of a is the entire block. JavaScript does hoist the variables 
defined by let, but, when it does, it creates a "temporal dead zone" in which the variable 
exists but doesn't have a value -- not even a value of undefined. We talk more about the 
temporal dead zone in a later course.

Note that the variable a defined on line 6 shadows the variable a defined on line 2.
