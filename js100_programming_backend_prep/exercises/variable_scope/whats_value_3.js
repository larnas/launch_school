if (true) {
  let myValue = 20;
}

console.log(myValue); // -> error

/* 
Solution:

ReferenceError: myValue is not defined

Variables declared with let are block scoped. This means that when we declare 
the variable myValue within a block on line 2, that variable is not accessible 
outside of the block on line 5, and a ReferenceError is raised.
