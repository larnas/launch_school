// Take your code from the previous exercise and rewrite the conditional 
// so that it uses the ternary if-then-else operator.

let randomNumber = Math.round(Math.random());

console.log(randomNumber === 1 ? "Yes": "No");

randomNumber ? console.log('Yes!') : console.log('No.');

/*
This is a perfectly fine solution. Ours is an alternative that uses the 
ternary operator only to decide on the string that is going to be logged. 
Take a close look at it: The expression randomNumber ? 'Yes!' : 'No.' evaluates 
to either the string 'Yes!' or the string 'No.'. Since it is an expression that 
evaluates to a string value, we can use it as an argument to console.log. 
It's similar to using other complex expressions with operators, as in 
console.log('Hello' + 'World').
