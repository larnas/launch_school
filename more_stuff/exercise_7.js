/* 
What is exception handling and what problem does it solve?

Is a method to bypass errors we know that may acured
and effect our program. So we add exceptions rules to avoid them.

Solution
--------
Exception handling is a process that deals with errors 
in a manageable and predictable manner. It uses the try/catch 
statement to catch exceptions that the code in the try block raises, 
and lets the programmer deal with the problem in a way that makes sense 
and perhaps prevents a catastrophic failure or nasty bug.
